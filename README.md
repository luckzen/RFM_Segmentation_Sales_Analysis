# RFM_Segmentation_Sales_Analysis
### The primary objective of the project is to Analyse sales and to build a RFM segmentation model to help us understand our customers better.



### Analysis List

1. Sales Analysis
   
This analysis aims to answer the question of the sales trends of products. The result of this can help use measure the effectiveness of each sales strategy the business applies and what modificatoins are needed to gain more sales.

2. Product Analysis
   
This analysis on the data will help us to understand the different product lines, the products lines performing best, product lines that are mostly sold together and the product lines that needs to be improved.

3. Customer Analysis
   
This analysis aims to uncover the different customers segments thru RFM Segmentation.(ie "Lost Customer", "Slipping away", "New Customer", Potential Churner", "Active Customer", "Loyal Customer")
This is because as much as getting new customers is important, retaining customers that are still willing to spend money is equally importand if not more importand.
